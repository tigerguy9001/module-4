                <p class="addendum-content">Going through the design process of my website, I knew I wanted to replicate closely my resume’s layout. My resume contains the typical subjects which are 
                    personal statement, education, skills and abilities, and work experience. To divide each subject into their own sections, I used the heading2 element and adjusted 
                    its appearance with the styles attribute so that they divide each section. For example, I made the bottom portion of each header’s border solid black to present 
                    the content and each font size bigger than the content. I used lists in almost all parts of the page’s content because they help organize each of the descriptions 
                    of each section. </p>
