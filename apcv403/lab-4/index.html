            <h1 class="addendum-heading">Addendum</h1>
                <p class="addendum-content">After going through the process of editing my resume website, I found that there could be improvements in with its looks. For one, the font in the original website used a default 
                    font embedded in the body so that all the text in the website had the same font. I did not think that was going to work out, so I went on Google Fonts to embed a couple of font options into certain texts. 
                    For example, the heading1 and all heading2 elements used the "Cabin" font-family from Google Fonts because they are the main focus in the website. The description texts, like the Work Experience's bullet 
                    points and Personal Statement text, use the same font, "Overpass", to differentiate itself from the headings. I made sure to make each of the heading2 elements, the sections of the website, to be bigger 
                    than its contents to separate each of their contents from the others. I decided to keep the black-and-white look of the website since I did not think it needed color other than the background. The background 
                    sports a turquose and white gradient to add some flavor. The contents of each section use divs because I can control the content's looks. For one, I added a bottom margin to the divs to separate it from each 
                    of the section's headers. I also added some padding in the main element so that the border lines from the heading2 elements don't touch the edge. I think it looks better like that rather than having them 
                    touch it. The li elements, which are the bulleted elements in the Education and Work Experience sections, have some margin to compress the text because it allows the user to center its focus to the middle of 
                    the page. </p>
